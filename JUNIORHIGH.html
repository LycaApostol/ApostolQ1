		<p id="pag1"><b>I</b> started junior high school at <b><q>Tisa National High School</q></b>. I have a lot of experience in school.In my school, I have friends, although every grade level is different, I have different friends,as long as I don't stay in a circle of friends if I know that they have different personalities or are toxic,but in my grade 8 days, I found my best friend, my best friend who has stayed by my side until now,shes the only person that I trust. In my 10th grade, when I was included in the list of the pilot section,I was nervous because I knew that they were bright and competitive and I was afraid that I might be their idiot, but I was wrong,first day of class welcoming they are all very approachable. We started bonding not as a section or schoolmates but as a family,if one has a problem it's a problem for everyone, if we go down, then we go down together, that's our motto. But of course small fights cannot be avoided,but if there are activities or performance tasks that need the cooperation of all of us, we will put the fights for the time being and will perform as one.If you are in a higher sections, there is a competitive side. I learned so many things in my junior high school days.</p>
